## Why are no consumption values displayed in Grafana?

Unfortunately the Tesla API does not return consumption values for a trip. In order to still be able to display values TeslaMate estimates the consumption on the basis of the recorded (charging) data. It takes **at least two** charging sessions before the first estimate can be displayed. Each charging session will slightly improve the accuracy of the estimate, which is applied retroactively to all data.

## What is the geo-fence feature for?

At the moment geo-fences are a way to create custom locations like `üè° Home` or `üõ†Ô∏è Work` That may be particularly useful if the addresses (which are provided by [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)) in your region are inaccurate or if you street-park at locations where the exact address may vary.

## How do I use my API tokens instead of my Tesla username/password?

First of all, from a security point of view, it makes no difference whether you create the tokens manually or via the login screen. The steps described below illustrate exactly what happens automatically when you sign in regularly via the web interface. Also, **TeslaMate only stores the API tokens, but not your credentials**.

If you still do not want to enter your Tesla password under any circumstances and you know what you are doing, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command on any linux/unix console that has curl installed replacing `YOURTESLAEMAIL@DOMAIN.COM` and `YOURPASSWORD` as appropriate:

   ```bash
   $ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          -d '{"grant_type": "password", "client_id": "81527cff06843c8634fdc09e8ac0abefb46ac849f38fe1e431c2ef2106796384", "client_secret": "c7257eb71a564034f9419ee651c7d0e5f7aa6bfbd18bafb5c5c033b093bb2fa3", "email": "YOURTESLAEMAIL@DOMAIN.COM","password": "YOURPASSWORD"}' \
          'https://owner-api.teslamotors.com/oauth/token'
   ```

   Returns:

   ```json {3-4}
   {
     "token_type": "bearer",
     "access_token": "YOURACCESSTOKEN",
     "refresh_token": "YOURREFRESHTOKEN",
     "expires_in": 3888000,
     "created_at": 1579971894
   }
   ```

2. Connect to the database container:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec database psql -U teslamate -d teslamate
   ```

   And insert the values from curl into the table `tokens`:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO tokens
       VALUES(DEFAULT, 'YOURACCESSTOKEN', 'YOURREFRESHTOKEN', NOW(), NOW());
   ```

3. Restart TeslaMate to pick up new values

   ```bash
   docker-compose restart
   ```

At this point it should automatically pick up your tokens and bypass the login screen on the TeslaMate web interface. If it does not, look for errors in the logs.
