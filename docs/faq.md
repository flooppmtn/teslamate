# Frequently Asked Questions

**Why are no consumption values displayed in Grafana?**

Unfortunately the Tesla API does not return consumption values for a trip. In
order to still be able to display values TeslaMate estimates the consumption on
the basis of the recorded (charging) data. It takes **at least two** charging
sessions before the first estimate can be displayed. Each charging session will
slightly improve the accuracy of the estimate, which is applied retroactively
to all data.

**What is the geo-fence feature for?**

At the moment geo-fences are a way to create custom locations like `üè° Home` or
`üõ†Ô∏è Work` That may be particularly useful if the addresses (which are provided
by [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org)) in your region are inaccurate or if
you street-park at locations where the exact address may vary.

**How do I use my API token instead of my Tesla username/password?**

Run the following command on any linux/unix console that has curl installed replacing `YOURTESLAEMAIL@DOMAIN.COM` and `YOURPASSWORD` as appropriate:
```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"grant_type": "password", "client_id": "81527cff06843c8634fdc09e8ac0abefb46ac849f38fe1e431c2ef2106796384", "client_secret": "c7257eb71a564034f9419ee651c7d0e5f7aa6bfbd18bafb5c5c033b093bb2fa3", "email": "YOURTESLAEMAIL@DOMAIN.COM","password": "YOURPASSWORD"}' 'https://owner-api.teslamotors.com/oauth/token'
```

returns:
`{"access_token":"YOURACCESSTOKEN","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":3888000,"refresh_token":"YOURREFRESHTOKEN","created_at":1579971894}`

Spawn a shell in the database docker

`docker exec -it teslamate_db_1 psql -U teslamate`

OR if you're not using docker just run `psql -U teslamate`

connect to the teslamate database:

`\c teslamate`

Insert values from curl into table tokens:

`INSERT INTO tokens VALUES(DEFAULT, 'YOURACCESSTOKEN','YOURREFRESHTOKEN',current_timestamp,current_timestamp);`

Verify that the insert ran correctly

`SELECT * FROM tokens;`

Exit out of PSQL

`\q`

Restart teslamate to pick up new values

`docker-compose restart`

OR if running in forground
```
CTRL-C
docker-compose up
```

At this point it should automatically pick up your token and bypass the login screen on the teslamate web interface.  If it does not look for errors in the docker or Teslamate log files.
