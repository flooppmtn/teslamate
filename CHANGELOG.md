# Changelog

## [1.5.3] - 2019-08-14

### Fixed

- Add extra values to the "Time to Try Sleeping" dropdown
- Rollback the "Time to Try Sleeping" setting to previous pre v1.5 value (21 min) to play it safe

  **Note to Model 3 owners and everyone who likes to tweak things a bit**: most
  cars seem to handle a value of 12min just fine. Doing so reduces the
  likelihood of potential data gaps. Just keep an eye on your car afterwards to
  see if it still goes into sleep mode.

- Enable filtering of charges by date
- Fix charges query to include the very first charge

## [1.5.2] - 2019-08-13

### Fixed

- Fix migration that could panic if upgrading from &lt;v1.4.3 to v1.5

## [1.5.1] - 2019-08-13

### Fixed

- Remove `shift_state` condition which could prevent some cars from falling asleep

## [1.5.0] - 2019-08-12

### Added

- Add geo-fence feature
- Make units of length and temperature separately configurable
- Make `time to try sleeping` and `idle time before trying to sleep` configurable
- Show buttons `try to sleep` and `cancel sleep attempt` on status screen if possible
- Add charging stats: charged in total, total number of charges, top charging stations

### Changed

- Reduce time to try sleeping from 21 to 12 minutes
- Increase test coverage
- Rename some dashboards / panels

### Fixed

- Add order by clause to degradation query
- Read `LOCALE` at runtime

## 1.4

**1. New custom grafana image: `teslamate/grafana`**

Starting with this release there is a customized Grafana docker image
(`teslamate/grafana`) that auto provisions the datasource and dashboards which
makes upgrading a breeze! I strongly recommend to use it instead of manually
re-importing dashboards.

Just replace the `grafana` service in your `docker-compose.yml`:

```YAML
  # ...

  grafana:
    image: teslamate/grafana:latest
    environment:
      - DATABASE_USER=teslamate
      - DATABASE_PASS=secret
      - DATABASE_NAME=teslamate
      - DATABASE_HOST=db
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - teslamate-grafana-data:/var/lib/grafana

  # ...
```

And add a new volume at the bottom of the file:

```YAML
volumes:
    # ...
    teslamate-grafana-data:
    # ...
```

Find the full example in the updated README.

**2. Switch to imperial units**

![Settings](screenshots/settings.png)

There is a new settings view in the web interface. To use imperial measurements
in grafana and on the status screen just tick the checkbox it shows!

**3. Deprecation of TESLA_USERNAME and TESLA_PASSWORD**

With this release API tokens are stored in the database. After starting
TeslaMate v1.4 once, you can safely remove both environment variables.

New users need to sign in via the web interface.

## [1.4.3] - 2019-08-05

### Added

- Status screen: show additional charging related information
- MQTT: add new topics

  ```text
  teslamate/cars/$car_id/plugged_in
  teslamate/cars/$car_id/scheduled_charging_start_time
  teslamate/cars/$car_id/charge_limit_soc
  ```

### Fixed

- Fix an issue where charging processes were not completed and new charging
  processes were created after waking up from sleep mode while still plugged in
  to a charger.
- Add migration to fix incomplete charging processes
- Use local time in debug logs:

  Add a `TZ` variable with your local timezone name to the environment of the
  `teslamate` container. Otherwise timestamps use UTC.

- Charging History: hide entries with 0kWh charge energy added
- Charging History: include current `car-id` in links to `Charging` dashboard
- Charging History: use slightly earlier start date in links to `Charging`
  dashboard to always show the current position
